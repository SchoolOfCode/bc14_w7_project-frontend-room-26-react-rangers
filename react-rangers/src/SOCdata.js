    title: "CSS - Cascading Style Sheets",
    content: "CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used for styling and formatting web documents. It allows developers to separate the content of a webpage from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and modify the site's appearance. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying specific styles to them. These styles can include colors, fonts, margins, borders, and more. CSS can be written inline within the HTML file, in a separate file that's linked to the HTML file, or within the head section of an HTML file. CSS uses a cascading model, where styles applied to a parent element will affect all of its child elements unless they are overridden. Specificity is used to determine which styles take precedence when there are conflicting styles applied to an element. CSS also includes a variety of selectors that allow developers to target specific elements on a page. Some common selectors include element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and pseudo-selectors. In addition to basic styling, CSS also includes advanced features like responsive design, which allows developers to create webpages that adjust to different screen sizes, and animations, which add movement and interactivity to a webpage. Frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation provide pre-written CSS and HTML code for developers to use, making it easier to create responsive and attractive websites. However, it's important to have a strong understanding of CSS in order to customize these frameworks and create unique designs. CSS is constantly evolving, with new features and updates being added regularly. Keeping up with the latest changes and best practices is important for any web developer looking to create modern, responsive, and visually appealing websites.",

    questionprompt: "React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs) in web applications. It is an open-source library developed by Facebook and has become one of the most popular libraries for building modern web applications. At its core, React uses a component-based architecture, where each component represents a part of the UI that can be reused across the application. React components are typically written in JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. React components can be divided into two main types: class components and functional components. Class components are defined using a class keyword and have access to lifecycle methods, while functional components are defined using a function and are simpler and easier to understand.React components can also have state, which is a JavaScript object that stores data that can change over time. Changes in state trigger the re-rendering of the component, updating the UI to reflect the new state. To use React in a web application, developers typically use a build tool such as Webpack or Create React App to compile their code and generate a production-ready build. The resulting build can then be deployed to a web server or a cloud-based service provider such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform.",

Objects are used to represent real-world entities or concepts and can be used to organize and manipulate data in a program. In React, objects are often used to represent the state and props of a component. The state object contains data that can change over time and triggers re-rendering of the component when the state changes, while the props object contains data that is passed down from a parent component to a child component.",
